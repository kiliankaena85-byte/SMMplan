## 2. Completed Remediation Items

### A. Broken Legal Links
*   **File Modified**: `src/components/landing/order-engine/MassOrderPreview.tsx`
*   **Fix**: Corrected outdated legal document links from `/terms` and `/privacy` to `/legal/terms` and `/legal/privacy`.

### B. Touch Target Remediations (>= 44x44px)
To comply with the Google Android/iOS guidelines and WCAG 2.2 AA target size criteria (>= 44x44px clickable target), the following components were remediated:
1.  **MobileWizard.tsx**:
    *   PRO Mode toggle button resized to `h-11` (44px).
    *   "Show All Tariffs" button heights increased to `h-11`.
    *   "Guide/Help" button trigger target padded/sized to `h-11`.
    *   "View Other Tariffs" link trigger padded/sized to `h-11`.
    *   Step 2 "Back to category" button height increased to `h-11`.
2.  **PaymentGatewaySelectionModal.tsx**: Close modal button width/height increased to `w-11 h-11`.
3.  **dialog.tsx** (Global Dialog Component): Main close button enlarged to `w-11 h-11`.
4.  **OrderSummaryCard.tsx**: Drip Feed toggle and details expander targets increased to `h-11` / `w-11`.
5.  **DripFeedSettings.tsx**: Settings update inputs and decrement/increment buttons increased to `h-11`.
6.  **SmartOrderForm.tsx**: Sync update buttons inside the smart orders grid increased to `h-11`.
7.  **ChatWindow.tsx**:
    *   Load older messages button styled to `h-11`.
    *   Reply, edit, and delete action triggers enlarged to a minimum height/width of 44px (`h-11 w-11` or padded container).
    *   Inline edit cancellation (`Отмена`) and confirmation (`Сохранить`) buttons resized to `h-11`.
    *   Staff note toggle and post/save triggers enlarged to `h-11`.

### C. Contrast and Color Token Standardization
*   Removed hardcoded/non-standard values (e.g. `text-amber-600`, `text-emerald-600`) and replaced them with standard design token colors mapping to semantic variables defined in `@theme` of `src/app/globals.css`:
    *   `text-success-text` (replaces hardcoded emerald text).
    *   `text-warning-text` (replaces hardcoded amber text).
*   **Files Modified**:
    *   `src/components/orders/DripFeedSettings.tsx` (emerald replaced with `success-text`)
    *   `src/components/support/ClientProfileSidebar.tsx` (amber text and background replaced with `text-warning-text bg-warning/10`)
    *   `src/components/dashboard/transactions/TransactionsClient.tsx` (amber and emerald statuses/cents replaced with `text-warning-text` and `text-success-text`)

### D. Accessibility & Semantic HTML Improvements
*   Added `aria-label` attributes to all custom interactive elements (toggles, close buttons, action triggers) that lack clear text content.
*   Added Russian localization support for global screen readers (e.g., standard global close buttons now read `"Закрыть диалоговое окно"`).
*   Added explicit `type="button"` attributes to interactive elements to prevent unintended form submission bugs.

### E. Cleanup of Workspace Clutter
*   Deleted the temporary developer script `src/check-cats-temp.ts`.
