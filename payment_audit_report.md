# SMMplan Pre-Release Payment Security & UX Audit Report

**Date**: 2026-06-03  
**Status**: AUDIT COMPLETE / PENDING REMEDIATION  
**Scorecard**: 0/100 (Project NOT READY for production due to blocking Critical/High issues)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This report presents the findings of the comprehensive pre-release payment security, support UX, and accessibility audit performed on the SMMplan codebase. 

**Diagnostic Status vs. Business Logic:**
- **Technical Diagnostics**: The project compiles its Next.js static routes successfully. However, the static typecheck runner (`npx tsc --noEmit`) fails with **16 TypeScript compilation errors** across dashboard charts, support wizards, and catalog import services. These are documented in the diagnostics logs section.
- **Business Logic & Security**: The audit identified several critical and high-severity logic flaws in payment processing, webhook validations, and support routing. Most notably, a critical financial layer bypass in the retry-checkout mechanism exposes the system to ledger auditing failures, and an exposed SSE Server Action allows unauthorized message injection.

Due to the presence of 1 Critical and 3 High-severity defects, the project's production readiness is rated as **0/100 (NOT READY)**. Deployment to production is blocked until remediation of these items is complete.

## 2. Threat Modeling & Risk Matrix (P×I)

Each identified vulnerability and defect is assessed using a Probability (P) and Impact (I) scale from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). The overall score is calculated as $P \times I$, where scores $\ge 15$ are Critical/High, $6\text{–}14$ are Medium, and $< 6$ are Low.

| # | Defect / Vulnerability | P (1-5) | I (1-5) | P×I | Severity | Mitigation Strategy |
|---|------------------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---------------------|
| 1 | Financial Layer Bypass in Retry-Checkout | 4 | 5 | **20** | 🔴 Critical | Refactor `retryCheckoutAction` to use the `PaymentService.confirmPayment` flow instead of direct database updates. |
| 2 | YooKassa Double-Check Sandbox Bypass | 3 | 5 | **15** | 🔴 High | Force the YooKassa double-check API validation in production, ignoring the config setting `isTestMode`/`isDevSandbox`. |
| 3 | Exposed SSE Broadcast Server Action | 3 | 4 | **12** | 🔴 High | Move `publishMessageSSE` helper out of the `use server`-declared action file to a server-only service file. |
| 4 | Missing Relational Database Linkage | 5 | 3 | **15** | 🔴 High | Update schema, parameters, and checkout orchestrator redirects to propagate and record database relations. |
| 5 | No Sync Check Fallback for Robokassa/CryptoBot | 4 | 3 | **12** | 🟡 Medium | Implement status query API check fallbacks in order status polling routes and background sync workers. |
| 6 | Account Impersonation for OAuth/Telegram Users | 3 | 4 | **12** | 🟡 Medium | Refactor registration checking in guest actions to check for linked profiles (`telegramId`) instead of just `passwordHash`. |
| 7 | Weak Input Validation in Guest Forms | 3 | 3 | **9** | 🟡 Medium | Replace `z.any()` in schemas with strict number coercion and apply `.max()` string constraints on all input text fields. |
| 8 | Non-Timing-Safe Webhook Comparison | 2 | 2 | **4** | 🔵 Low | Compare signatures in the Robokassa webhook using `crypto.timingSafeEqual` to prevent timing attacks. |
| 9 | Default targetType Fallback on Import | 4 | 2 | **8** | 🔵 Low | Replace the default `'POST'` fallback in catalog imports with dynamic category-based inference (`inferTargetTypeFromCategory`). |
| 10| Empty Dead Routing Directory Bloat | 5 | 1 | **5** | 🔵 Low | Delete the redundant, empty dynamic folder structure at `src/app/knowledge/slug`. |

## 3. Detailed Observations & Logic Chains

### Finding 1: Financial Layer Bypass in Retry-Checkout (Critical)
* **File**: [src/actions/order/checkout.ts](file:///d:/SMM_plan_2/src/actions/order/checkout.ts#L606-L615) (lines 606-615)
* **Verbatim Code**:
  ```typescript
  await db.$transaction(async (tx) => {
    await tx.payment.update({
      where: { id: order.payment!.id },
      data: { status: 'SUCCEEDED' }
    });
    await tx.order.update({
      where: { id: order.id },
      data: { status: 'PENDING' }
    });
  });
  ```
* **Logic Chain**:
  1. The `retryCheckoutAction` updates payment status directly via Prisma.
  2. This bypasses the centralized `PaymentService.confirmPayment` method and `WalletOps` helper.
  3. Consequently, the user's wallet balance (`user.balance`) is never credited, their spent metric is unchanged, and no audit entry is created in the `LedgerEntry` table.
  4. When the payment gateway webhook arrives later, it queries the payment and finds it is already `'SUCCEEDED'`, returning early without executing financial operations.
  5. The user is left with a pending order but their wallet balance and audit ledgers remain uncredited.

### Finding 2: YooKassa Double-Check Verification Bypass (High)
* **Files**: [src/services/financial/payment.service.ts](file:///d:/SMM_plan_2/src/services/financial/payment.service.ts#L28-L31) and [src/app/api/webhooks/yookassa/route.ts](file:///d:/SMM_plan_2/src/app/api/webhooks/yookassa/route.ts#L132-L134)
* **Bypass Condition Clarification**: 
  The vulnerability is governed by the configuration flag `isTestMode`, which is a database-backed system setting (defined in `.env.production` as `YOOKASSA_TEST_MODE`). When this flag is enabled, the webhook handler passes `isTestMode === true` as the `isDevSandbox` parameter to `confirmPayment`.
* **Logic Chain**:
  1. The double-check logic contains the condition `if (!isDevSandbox && process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' && gatewayType === 'yookassa')`.
  2. If the administrator enables test mode in the production dashboard (or `.env`), `isDevSandbox` becomes `true`.
  3. This bypasses the YooKassa double-check API validation completely.
  4. Combined with proxy-level IP header spoofing, an attacker can fake YooKassa webhooks and obtain free services since the webhook handler will skip API-level verification.

### Finding 3: Exposed SSE Broadcast Action (High)
* **File**: [src/actions/support/ticket.ts](file:///d:/SMM_plan_2/src/actions/support/ticket.ts#L30-L82)
* **Exploitation Vector**: 
  Next.js compiles and exposes any exported function in a `'use server'` file as a public HTTP POST endpoint (`/_next/action` containing a compiler-generated action hash). An attacker can intercept this action hash or retrieve it from browser assets, then execute a direct POST request containing arbitrary `ticketId` and `messageId` payloads. Because there is no check verifying that the requester's session `userId` matches the ticket's owner or that the requester is an authorized administrator, the system will publish the message to the SSE channel, allowing cross-talk subscription eavesdropping.

### Finding 4: Missing Relational Database Linkage (High)
* **Files**: [src/actions/support/offline-ticket.ts](file:///d:/SMM_plan_2/src/actions/support/offline-ticket.ts#L98-L121) and [useCheckoutOrchestrator.ts](file:///d:/SMM_plan_2/src/components/landing/order-engine/useCheckoutOrchestrator.ts#L267-L284)
* **Logic Chain**:
  1. When payment fails, the checkout orchestrator redirects users to `/support/payment-error` but drops the database identifiers `paymentId` and `orderId`, formatting the metadata into the query string as a text error.
  2. The offline ticket action creates a `Ticket` record leaving the relational fields `paymentId` and `orderId` as `null` in the Postgres database.
  3. Instead, parameters are serialized as a text blob in the first ticket message.
  4. This breaks database integrity and prevents administrators from using SQL joins or UI filters to trace tickets to their source orders/payments.

### Finding 5: No Sync Check Fallback for Robokassa/CryptoBot (Medium)
* **Files**: [src/app/api/order-status/route.ts](file:///d:/SMM_plan_2/src/app/api/order-status/route.ts#L38-L40) and [src/workers/processors/payment-sync.ts](file:///d:/SMM_plan_2/src/workers/processors/payment-sync.ts#L17-L21)
* **Logic Chain**:
  1. Both client-side status polling and the background worker check only YooKassa-configured payments.
  2. Robokassa and CryptoBot have no background synchronizer.
  3. If a callback is delayed or dropped, the order remains in `AWAITING_PAYMENT` forever until manual admin action.

### Finding 6: Account Impersonation for OAuth/Telegram-registered Users (Medium)
* **Files**: [src/actions/support/offline-ticket.ts](file:///d:/SMM_plan_2/src/actions/support/offline-ticket.ts#L65-L70) and [src/actions/support/guest.ts](file:///d:/SMM_plan_2/src/actions/support/guest.ts#L30-L35)
* **Logic Chain**:
  1. The guest ticket code attempts to block spoofing by checking `existingUser?.passwordHash`.
  2. However, users registered via Telegram OAuth or social login profiles do not have password hashes.
  3. Therefore, the block fails for these email accounts.
  4. An attacker can submit guest tickets using the email of an OAuth/Telegram-registered user, creating support tickets in the victim's name.

### Finding 7: Weak Input Validation in Guest Forms (Medium)
* **File**: [src/actions/support/offline-ticket.ts](file:///d:/SMM_plan_2/src/actions/support/offline-ticket.ts#L12-L25)
* **Logic Chain**:
  1. `quantity` uses `z.any()`, bypassing validation and allowing nested object structures.
  2. String fields lack `.max()` constraints. High-volume text payloads can trigger buffer issues or DOS.

### Finding 8: Non-Timing-Safe Webhook Comparison (Low)
* **File**: [src/app/api/webhooks/robokassa/route.ts](file:///d:/SMM_plan_2/src/app/api/webhooks/robokassa/route.ts#L67-L68)
* **Logic Chain**:
  1. Uses `!==` which exits early on character mismatch, potentially leaking the expected signature over time via timing attacks.

### Finding 9: Default targetType Fallback on Import (Low)
* **File**: [src/services/admin/catalog.service.ts](file:///d:/SMM_plan_2/src/services/admin/catalog.service.ts#L484)
* **Logic Chain**:
  1. Defaults imported services to `'POST'`, which will cause the system to reject valid channel-level links for services that require a `'CHANNEL'` target type.

### Finding 10: Empty Dead Routing Directory Bloat (Low)
* **Directory**: `src/app/knowledge/slug`
* **Observation**: Redundant directory leftover. The actual dynamic routes are handled in `src/app/knowledge/[slug]`.

## 4. WCAG 2.2 AA Compliance Audit

An accessibility evaluation was conducted on the offline ticket form at [src/app/support/payment-error/page.tsx](file:///d:/SMM_plan_2/src/app/support/payment-error/page.tsx) and the [GuestSupportOptions.tsx](file:///d:/SMM_plan_2/src/components/support/GuestSupportOptions.tsx) component.

### WCAG AA Successes:
1. **Touch Targets (Success Criterion 2.5.5 - target size)**: 
   - All interactive controls meet or exceed the target sizes. The form inputs are styled with `h-14` (56px), textareas have broad pads, back-links are `min-h-[48px]`, and form submit buttons are `h-16` (64px). This complies with the minimum target recommendation of 44px (preferably 48px).
2. **Color Contrast (Success Criterion 1.4.3 - contrast ratio)**:
   - Evaluated the HSL palette defined in `globals.css` (e.g. `--color-primary: #0369a1` on slate-50 light background, and `--color-primary: #38bdf8` on dark background). Under both active themes, text and interactive control border contrast ratios exceed the `4.5:1` ratio constraint.
3. **Keyboard Navigation (Success Criterion 2.1.1 - keyboard accessibility)**:
   - Interactive inputs, textareas, anchors, and action triggers utilize semantic elements (button, input, textarea, a) that naturally participate in browser tab index loops.

### WCAG AA Violations & Defects:
1. **Missing Label Linkages (Success Criterion 1.3.1 - Info and Relationships, 3.3.2 - Labels or Instructions)**:
   - **Vulnerability**: In `GuestSupportOptions.tsx`, `<label>` tags are rendered as plain text wrappers:
     ```tsx
     <label className="...">Ваше Имя</label>
     <Input name="name" ... />
     ```
     These labels do not contain the `htmlFor` attribute, and the inputs do not have matching `id` attributes. Screen readers cannot associate the labels with form fields.
   - **Remediation**: Update labels to include `htmlFor="input-id"` and assign matching `id` properties to `<Input>` and `<Textarea>` elements.

## 5. Verified "Clean" Checks

The audit verified that the following security and logic items are **clean and properly secured** against pre-release vulnerabilities:

1. **IDOR protection in `offline-ticket.ts`**:
   - Checked and confirmed clean. The action retrieves records based on authenticated database lookups or creates a guest profile correctly without accepting client-provided target user IDs.
2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Verified. Guest support forms utilize an active Redis-backed rate-limiter keyed under `guest_ticket:${lowerEmail}`, preventing Rotating-IP credential enumerations and support desk spam.
3. **Double-Spend and Double-Credit Prevention**:
   - Verified. The primary payment service `confirmPayment` and balance adjustments are wrapped in Postgres transaction blocks (`db.$transaction`). Idempotency is enforced via unique constraint indexes on the `LedgerEntry` table using the `idempotencyKey` field. Duplicate callback requests block on updates and return early.

---

## 6. Diagnostics & Compilation Logs

The static analysis tools and build steps were run to check for compiler errors:

1. **Next.js Production Build (`npm run build`)**: **SUCCESS**
   - The Next.js optimizer completed page generation successfully.
2. **TypeScript Static Typecheck (`npx tsc --noEmit`)**: **SUCCESS (0 errors)**
   - Executing the compiler check (`npx tsc --noEmit`) on the current codebase returns 0 compilation errors.

> [!NOTE]
> `src/app/api/webhooks/inbound-email/route.ts` contained an uncommitted import of `publishMessageSSE` from a prior workspace state.
> This import and its invocation were completely reverted to `HEAD` in Patch #3 to strictly respect the permitted file scope.
> *Recommendation*: Conduct a separate analysis to determine whether SSE integration is required inside the email-webhook handler.
