# Handoff Report - Marketing Description Rewriter Implementation

## 1. Observation
- The SMM service marketing description rewriter script `scripts/marketing-description-rewriter.ts` has been fully implemented. It connects to the database via Prisma client, matches active services to provider specifications via Redis cache (with provider API fallback and 24h caching), queries Gemini (`gemini-3-flash` or `gemini-3-flash-preview`) via REST HTTP fetch, updates the `Service` model, and inserts admin audits (`action: "SERVICE_AUTO_FIX"`, `adminEmail: "system@smmplan.pro"`). It also fully supports the `--dry-run` CLI flag.
- The unit test file `test/unit/marketing-rewrite.test.ts` has been implemented under Vitest, which mocks all external systems (Prisma, Redis, provider service, and Gemini fetch) to guarantee no external network calls during testing.
- An independent review by `reviewer_1` (Conv ID: `1652816f-f6bd-4a8e-b7ed-6fa75f369419`) was completed and approved (`APPROVE` verdict).
- An independent forensic integrity audit by `auditor_1` (Conv ID: `688de517-daaa-4fb9-aa20-d0f60421d579`) was completed and marked clean (`CLEAN` verdict).
- Validation commands have been executed and recorded:
  - TypeScript Compilation (`npx tsc --noEmit`): Passed with 0 errors.
  - Linting (`npm run lint`): Passed with 0 style/lint violations.
  - Vitest Unit Tests (`npx vitest run test/unit/marketing-rewrite.test.ts`): Passed with 6/6 tests successful.
  - Production Build Health (`npm run build`): Passed with 0 errors.

## 2. Logic Chain
- **Step 1 (Functional completeness)**: The rewriter script implements all requirements specified in the follow-up request (active selection, caching, B2B Russian Markdown lists, spam filtering, audit logging, and `--dry-run` mode).
- **Step 2 (Robustness and quality)**: Verification commands confirm there are no type errors, style lint violations, or compilation breaks during production builds.
- **Step 3 (Test coverage)**: The unit tests verify the main rewriter execution, cache hits, cache misses with provider fallbacks, dry-run output matching, and key-missing abort paths, confirming coverage is complete.
- **Step 4 (Integrity)**: The forensic auditor independently verified that the implementation is genuine (no mocks in production path, standard spy/mock assertions in tests) and contains no hardcoded secrets or bypasses.
- **Verdict**: The implementation is correct, verified, and complete.

## 3. Caveats
- **Live Gemini API limits**: Sequential runs on large catalogs could hit Gemini rate limits. The script uses a 1s delay and catches errors defensively to skip failed records, but lacks a consecutive failure-limit exit (e.g. exit after 10 failures), which is a potential production improvement.
- **API credential dependency**: Production execution requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` to be correctly configured in the runtime environment.

## 4. Conclusion
The SMM service marketing description rewriter script and its corresponding unit tests are fully ready for integration and production execution. All verification gates (compilation, lints, unit tests, and production build) have successfully passed with clean verdicts.

## 5. Verification Method
Verify the integration using the following commands in the workspace root:
1. **TypeScript compilation check**:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```
2. **ESLint style check**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
3. **Unit tests execution**:
   ```bash
   npx vitest run test/unit/marketing-rewrite.test.ts
   ```
4. **Dry-run simulation execution**:
   ```bash
   $env:GEMINI_API_KEY="dummy"; npx tsx scripts/marketing-description-rewriter.ts --dry-run
   ```
