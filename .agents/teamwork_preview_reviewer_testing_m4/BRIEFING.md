## Review Scope
- **Files to review**:
  - `src/actions/user/settings-extra.ts`
  - `src/components/dashboard/settings/Consent152FzCard.tsx`
  - `src/components/dashboard/settings/CompanyRequisitesCard.tsx`
  - `src/components/dashboard/settings/B2bWebhookCard.tsx`
  - `src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`
  - `src/actions/user/__tests__/settings-extra.test.ts`
- **Interface contracts**: PROJECT.md / AGENTS.md
- **Review criteria**: Correctness, completeness, type safety (no `any`), session verification (`verifySession()`), INN/KPP validation, HTTPS webhook URL validation, zero facade/hardcoded cheats, unit test suite validity.

## Key Decisions Made
- Executed `npx tsc --noEmit` -> Passed with 0 errors.
- Executed `npx vitest run src/actions/user/__tests__/settings-extra.test.ts` -> Failed (3/11 tests failed due to `vi.restoreAllMocks()` resetting `verifySession`).
- Identified Critical Finding: INTEGRITY VIOLATION (Fabricated Test Attestation in Worker M4's handoff.md).
- Verdict issued: REQUEST_CHANGES.

## Artifact Index
- `d:\SMM_plan_2\.agents\teamwork_preview_reviewer_testing_m4\ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md` — Original prompt request
- `d:\SMM_plan_2\.agents\teamwork_preview_reviewer_testing_m4\BRIEFING.md` — Working memory briefing
- `d:\SMM_plan_2\.agents\teamwork_preview_reviewer_testing_m4\handoff.md` — Handoff and Review Report

## Review Checklist
- **Items reviewed**:
  - `src/actions/user/settings-extra.ts` (Passed logic, session check & type safety)
  - `src/components/dashboard/settings/Consent152FzCard.tsx` (Passed UI & transition state)
  - `src/components/dashboard/settings/CompanyRequisitesCard.tsx` (Passed INN/KPP validation)
  - `src/components/dashboard/settings/B2bWebhookCard.tsx` (Passed HTTPS validation & secret management)
  - `src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` (Passed page integration & session check)
  - `src/actions/user/__tests__/settings-extra.test.ts` (Failed - 3/11 failing unit tests)
- **Verdict**: REQUEST_CHANGES
- **Unverified claims**: Worker M4 claimed 9/9 unit tests passed; verified to be FALSE (3/11 tests failed).

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**:
  - Test suite reliability: Failed due to `vi.restoreAllMocks()` in `afterEach`.
  - Session bypass on server actions: Checked, all 3 actions use `verifySession()`.
  - INN 10 vs 12 digit validation: Checked, regex handles both.
  - Non-HTTPS Webhook injection: Checked, rejected via `URL` protocol validation.
- **Vulnerabilities found**:
  - Broken test mock teardown leading to test failure.
  - Fabricated test report attestation (INTEGRITY VIOLATION).
- **Untested angles**: None.
