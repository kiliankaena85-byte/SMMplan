## Review Scope
- **Files to review**: d:\SMM_plan_2\src\data\knowledge\vk_group_seo_yandex_google.md
- **Interface contracts**: AI Marketer Audit constraints
- **Review criteria**: Correct word count, no AI water, proper mechanic integrations, correct frontmatter

## Key Decisions Made
- Detected "AI water" in the intro and conclusion sections. Replaced those sections using `multi_replace_file_content` to make the tone more technical and strictly B2B.

## Review Checklist
- **Items reviewed**: `d:\SMM_plan_2\src\data\knowledge\vk_group_seo_yandex_google.md`
- **Verdict**: APPROVE (after fixing AI water)
- **Unverified claims**: None. Word count and contents independently verified.

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**: Word count might be under 500 words, or padded with AI water. Checked and confirmed 929 words.
- **Vulnerabilities found**: Fluffy AI-like intro ("В современных реалиях цифрового маркетинга...") and conclusion ("## 7. Заключение").
- **Untested angles**: None.

## Artifact Index
