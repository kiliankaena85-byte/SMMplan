# Omni-Audit State & Compliance Record
**Project:** Smmplan
**Audit Framework:** 21-Discipline Holistic Hardening
**Date:** May 12, 2026
**Status:** FULLY HARDENED & COMPLIANT

This document serves as the final operational readiness and compliance report, tracking all remediation steps applied during the 21-Discipline Omni-Audit.

## Core Disciplines & Remediation Log

### 1. Financial & Ledger Integrity
* **Status:** Passed
* **Remediation:** Enforced `$transaction` blocks with `Serializable` isolation for all balance-altering operations. `failOrderTerminal` correctly cascades refunds for `IN_PROGRESS` or `PENDING` states automatically.
* **Result:** Zero-tolerance for Double-Spending or Ghost Liability.

### 2. Provider API Resilience
* **Status:** Passed
* **Remediation:** Integrated distributed Redis Circuit Breaker across external APIs to "Fail-Fast" and prevent connection thread-pool exhaustion.
* **Result:** Maximum latency caps are preserved.

### 3. Worker & Fault Tolerance (DLQ)
* **Status:** Passed
* **Remediation:** Configured Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) in BullMQ (`src/workers/index.ts`). Tasks exceeding retry boundaries trigger `failOrderTerminal()`.
* **Result:** No "stuck" orders. Completely automated lifecycle reconciliation.

### 4. Admin Action Auditing (A09 Security Compliance)
* **Status:** Passed
* **Remediation:** All mutations in the admin dashboard (e.g. Catalog Batch Updates, Price Overrides) are securely tracked via the `AdminAuditLog` mechanism.
* **Result:** Full non-repudiation and compliance tracking.

### 5. Performance Engineering (Database & Server caching)
* **Status:** Passed
* **Remediation:** Identified and patched severe N+1 DB load on public endpoints. Wrapped catalog and service queries in Next.js `unstable_cache`. Added precise cache invalidation `revalidateTag` in admin batch actions.
* **Result:** Near-instant catalog TTFB (Time To First Byte), greatly reducing CPU load on PostgreSQL during traffic spikes.

### 6. Module Deprecation & Technical Debt Pruning
* **Status:** Passed
* **Remediation:** Explicitly abandoned the **Churn Prediction** subsystem. All references and documentation updated to reflect this change (marked as DEPRECATED/CANCELED).
* **Result:** Reduced maintenance overhead and DB size, eliminating a non-essential analytical module in favor of core transaction integrity.

## Build & Production Readiness
* **TypeScript Health:** `tsc --noEmit` returns 0 exits (Strict Mode compliant).
* **Bundle Check:** `npm run build` succeeds seamlessly within the Next.js App Router paradigm. No invalid `"use server"` leakages.
* **Architecture Rules:** All boundaries (Client/Server) strictly adhered to as per `AGENTS.md`.
