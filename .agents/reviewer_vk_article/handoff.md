# Handoff Report

## Observation
- Viewed the contents of the generated article at `d:\SMM_plan_2\src\data\knowledge\vk_deleted_followers_dogs.md` using `view_file`.
- Word count checked using `Get-Content ... -split '\s+' | Measure-Object` tool returned 1085 words.
- The article is written entirely in Russian.
- Tone uses technical terminology: "Spike detection", "velocity check", "Trust Score", "Browser Fingerprinting", "ботнет-атака", "graceful degradation", "SLA", "drop-offs".
- The following Smmplan mechanics are explicitly featured in dedicated sections: `TargetType`, `Drip-Feed`, `PENDING_CHECK`, `PARTIAL`, `Refill/Гарантия`.
- The markdown contains a valid frontmatter block with title, category ("VK"), and seo_keywords array.

## Logic Chain
1. The requirement of > 500 words is met (actual count: 1085 words).
2. The language requirement is met (Russian).
3. The tone avoids 'AI fluff' and correctly adopts an expert, B2B, technical style.
4. All required Smmplan mechanics (`TargetType`, `Drip-Feed`, `PENDING_CHECK`, `PARTIAL`, `Refill`) are meaningfully integrated as solutions to VK's anti-fraud algorithms.
5. The frontmatter contains the required metadata.

## Caveats
- No caveats. The text fully complies with the provided requirements.

## Conclusion
**Verdict**: APPROVE
The article is excellently written, highly technical, and hits all the requested constraints perfectly.

## Verification Method
- **Word count**: Run `(Get-Content -Path "d:\SMM_plan_2\src\data\knowledge\vk_deleted_followers_dogs.md") -split '\s+' | Measure-Object | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Count` in PowerShell.
- **Content inspection**: Read `d:\SMM_plan_2\src\data\knowledge\vk_deleted_followers_dogs.md` manually to verify tone, mechanics integration, and frontmatter.
