# Handoff Report

## Observation
I reviewed the file `d:\SMM_plan_2\src\data\knowledge\vk_deleted_followers_dogs.md`. 
The file contains a 53-line markdown article.
The frontmatter includes `title`, `category: "VK"`, and `seo_keywords`.
The content contains sections detailing how VK's anti-fraud works ("Spike detection", "Trust Score") and maps Smmplan features (`TargetType`, `Drip-Feed`, `PENDING_CHECK`, `PARTIAL`, `Refill`) to solving these problems. The tone uses technical engineering terminology ("graceful degradation", "velocity check", "botnet-атаку"). The word count is approximately 850 words.

## Logic Chain
1. The requirement asks for word count > 500 words. The article is roughly 850 words, satisfying the requirement.
2. The requirement asks for the text to be in Russian. The article is fully written in Russian.
3. The requirement asks for a technical, B2B-focused, and expert tone without "AI water". The text uses terms like "graceful degradation", "обфускация всплесков", and "velocity check" instead of generic marketing fluff, fulfilling the tone requirement.
4. The requirement asks to integrate `TargetType`, `Drip-Feed`, `PENDING_CHECK`, `PARTIAL`, and `Refill`. All five are explicitly mentioned and logically tied to specific VK anti-fraud mechanisms (e.g., `Drip-Feed` counters `Spike detection`).
5. The requirement asks for proper Markdown frontmatter (`title`, `category` (VK), `seo_keywords`). The file starts with a YAML frontmatter block containing exactly these fields.

## Caveats
No caveats. The text perfectly aligns with the given instructions.

## Conclusion
The article meets all specified criteria. The integration of Smmplan mechanics is logical and well-justified in the context of avoiding VK anti-fraud penalties.

**Verdict**: APPROVE

## Verification Method
1. Open `d:\SMM_plan_2\src\data\knowledge\vk_deleted_followers_dogs.md`.
2. Inspect lines 1-5 for frontmatter.
3. Search for terms "TargetType", "Drip-Feed", "PENDING_CHECK", "PARTIAL", "Refill" in the text to ensure they are present.
4. Verify the tone is professional and technical.
